To store dump file for backup db, from one pc to other(my case, because modifying the project in 2 pc's)
Using pg_dump to transfer the data and load in other host
For postgres in docker first need to entry in cli of pgsql container

cli: docker ps #to find the container id
cli: docker exec -it id_container bash
root@id_container: pg_dump -U pgdck -d pgdck -F c -b -v -f /pgdata/pgdck.dump
exit

Where -U is user and -d the database, -F to format file and c is custom format 
-b to binary values too, -v is verbose output and -f final local save in volume,later exit terminal

In back to cli linux, do command to copy the file in dir where is execute this command
docker cp postsql:/pgdata/pgdck.dump . #The '.' indicate the current local

Later executing the same compose in other pc, do cp from local to container volume
docker cp pgdck.dump postsql:/pgdata/pgdck.dump

Now exec -it in container id from this container postgres and executing the command to restore the data from the volume
pg_restore -U pgdck -d pgdck -v /pgdata/pgdck.dump


One command to use the correct ip in connection master container from spark, where is the ip to communicate with docker, below command
ip addr show
